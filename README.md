IMU tools
===================================

Overview
-----------------------------------

IMU-related filters and visualizers. The stack contains:

 * `imu_filter_madgwick`: a filter which fuses angular velocities,
accelerations, and (optionally) magnetic readings from a generic IMU 
device into an orientation. Based on the work of [1].

 * `imu_complementary_filter`: a filter which fuses angular velocities,
accelerations, and (optionally) magnetic readings from a generic IMU 
device into an orientation quaternion using a novel approach based on a complementary fusion. Based on the work of [2].
